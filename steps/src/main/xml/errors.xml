<title>Step Errors</title>

<para>Several of the steps in the standard step library can generate
<glossterm baseform="dynamic-error">dynamic errors</glossterm>.</para>

<para>A <termdef xml:id="dt-dynamic-error">A <firstterm>dynamic
error</firstterm> is one which occurs while a pipeline is being
evaluated.</termdef> Examples of dynamic errors include references to
URIs that cannot be resolved, steps which fail, and pipelines that
exhaust the capacity of an implementation (such as memory or disk
space).</para>

<para>If a step fails due to a dynamic error, failure propagates
upwards until either a <tag>p:try</tag> is encountered or the entire
pipeline fails. In other words, outside of a <tag>p:try</tag>, step
failure causes the entire pipeline to fail.</para>

<para>The following errors can be raised by steps in this
specification:</para>
