<title>p:json-join</title>

<para>The <code>p:json-join</code> step joins a sequence of JSON
documents into a single JSON document (an array). If the sequence on
port <code>source</code> is empty, the empty sequence is returned on
port <code>result</code>.</para>

<p:declare-step type="p:json-join">
  <p:input port="source" sequence="true" content-types="json"> </p:input>
  <p:output port="result" content-types="application/json"/>
  <p:option name="flatten-to-depth" as="xs:string?" select="'0'"/>
</p:declare-step>

<para>The option <option>flatten-to-depth</option> controls whether and to which
depth members of an array appearing on port <port>source</port> are flattened.
The <option>flatten-to-depth</option> option may contain either the 
string “<literal>unbounded</literal>” or a string that may be cast to a non-negative integer. 
An integer value of <literal>0</literal>, which is the default, means that no 
flattening takes place, so the array appearing on port <port>source</port> will
be contained as an array in the resulting array. An integer value of <literal>1</literal>
means that an array on port <port>source</port> is flattened, i.e. the members
of that array will appear as individual members in the resulting array. Any value greater
than <literal>1</literal> means that the flattening is applied recursively to arrays in
arrays up to the given depth. A value of “<literal>unbounded</literal>” means that all
arrays in arrays will be flattened. As a consequence, the resulting array appearing on
port <port>result</port> will not have any arrays as members.</para>
